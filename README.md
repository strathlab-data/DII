## Overview

The **Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)** is a literature-derived, population-based index designed to assess the inflammatory potential of an individual's diet. This Python package provides a validated, efficient implementation for calculating DII scores from nutrient intake data.

**Key Features:**
- Vectorized calculations for high performance on large datasets
- Support for all 45 DII food parameters
- Graceful handling of missing nutrients
- Detailed output option for per-nutrient contribution analysis
- Bundled reference data (no external files required)
- Comprehensive validation against known test cases

### Interpretation

| DII Score | Dietary Pattern |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Negative (e.g., -4 to -1) | Anti-inflammatory diet |
| Near zero | Neutral inflammatory potential |
| Positive (e.g., +1 to +4) | Pro-inflammatory diet |

Scores typically range from approximately **-8** (maximally anti-inflammatory) to **+8** (maximally pro-inflammatory).

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from dii import calculate_dii

# Load your nutrient intake data
nutrients = pd.read_csv("your_nutrient_data.csv")

# Calculate DII scores
results = calculate_dii(nutrients, id_column="participant_id")

print(results.head())
#    participant_id  DII_score
# 0               1      -1.23
# 1               2       0.45
# 2               3       2.87
```

### Detailed Output

For transparency in the calculation, request detailed output:

```python
detailed = calculate_dii(nutrients, id_column="participant_id", detailed=True)

# View contribution of each nutrient
print(detailed[["participant_id", "Fiber_contribution", "Alcohol_contribution", "DII_score"]])
```

## Input Data Format

Your input DataFrame should contain columns named to match the DII reference nutrients. The following 45 nutrients are supported:

| Nutrient | Unit | Nutrient | Unit |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| Alcohol | g/day | Magnesium | mg/day |
| Beta-carotene | μg/day | MUFA | g/day |
| Caffeine | g/day | n-3 fatty acid | g/day |
| Carbohydrate | g/day | n-6 fatty acid | g/day |
| Cholesterol | mg/day | Niacin | mg/day |
| Energy | kcal/day | Onion | g/day |
| Eugenol | mg/day | Pepper | g/day |
| Fiber | g/day | Protein | g/day |
| Flavan-3-ol | mg/day | PUFA | g/day |
| Flavones | mg/day | Riboflavin | mg/day |
| Flavonols | mg/day | Rosemary | mg/day |
| Flavonones | mg/day | Saffron | mg/day |
| Folic acid | μg/day | Saturated fat | g/day |
| Garlic | g/day | Selenium | μg/day |
| Ginger | mg/day | Thiamin | mg/day |
| Green/black tea | g/day | Thyme/oregano | mg/day |
| Iron | mg/day | Total fat | g/day |
| Isoflavones | mg/day | Trans fat | g/day |
| Anthocyanidins | mg/day | Turmeric | mg/day |
| vitamin B6 | mg/day | Vitamin A | RE/day |
| vitamin B12 | μg/day | Vitamin C | mg/day |
| Zinc | mg/day | Vitamin D | μg/day |
| | | Vitamin E | mg/day |

**Note:** Column names must match exactly (case-sensitive). Nutrients not present in your data will be excluded from the calculation.

### Example Input CSV

```csv
participant_id,Fiber,Alcohol,Vitamin C,Saturated fat,Energy
1,18.8,13.98,118.2,28.6,2056
2,25.0,0.0,150.0,22.0,1800
3,12.0,30.0,80.0,35.0,2400
```

## API Reference

### `calculate_dii()`

```python
calculate_dii(
    nutrient_data: pd.DataFrame,
    reference_df: pd.DataFrame = None,
    id_column: str = None,
    detailed: bool = False
) -> pd.DataFrame
```

**Parameters:**
- `nutrient_data`: DataFrame with nutrient intake values
- `reference_df`: Custom reference table (optional, uses bundled data by default)
- `id_column`: Name of participant identifier column
- `detailed`: If True, returns per-nutrient breakdown

**Returns:** DataFrame with DII scores

### `get_available_nutrients()`

```python
get_available_nutrients() -> List[str]
```

Returns a list of all 45 supported nutrient names.

### `load_reference_table()`

```python
load_reference_table(custom_path: str = None) -> pd.DataFrame
```

Load the DII reference table with inflammatory weights and global statistics.

## Methodology

The DII calculation follows the standardized approach from Shivappa et al. (2014):

1. **Z-score standardization**: For each nutrient, compute:
   ```
   z = (intake - global_mean) / global_sd
   ```

2. **Centered percentile conversion**: Transform z-score to a value between -1 and +1:
   ```
   percentile = 2 × Φ(z) - 1
   ```
   where Φ is the standard normal CDF.

3. **Weighted summation**: Multiply each percentile by the nutrient's inflammatory weight and sum:
   ```
   DII = Σ (percentile_i × weight_i)
   ```

Positive weights indicate pro-inflammatory effects; negative weights indicate anti-inflammatory effects.

## Validation

This implementation has been validated against:
- Synthetic test cases with mathematically verifiable results (SEQN 1, 2, 3)
- The [dietaryindex R package](https://github.com/jamesjiadazhan/dietaryindex) methodology
- Original R implementation from PANDA-1 study statistician
- Independent verification by Jiyan Aslan Ceylan (University of Florida)

**Validation result:** 13,580 NHANES participants tested with perfect match to original calculations.

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Limitations

- **Nutrient availability**: DII accuracy depends on having data for as many of the 45 parameters as possible. Studies with limited nutrient data will have less precise scores.
- **Reference population**: Global means and SDs are derived from world literature circa 2014. Dietary patterns may have shifted.
- **Food-level data**: This package calculates DII from nutrient totals, not individual foods. Some DII parameters (e.g., garlic, turmeric) may be underestimated in datasets that don't capture specific foods.
- **Supplement data**: The DII was designed for dietary intake. Including supplement data may affect score interpretation.
